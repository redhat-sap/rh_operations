    short_description: Prepare container to run content from sap.sap_operations
    description:
      - Role ensures that all collection sap.sap_operations prerequisites are met on containers.
      - Role works in two modes - normal and assert.
      - In normal mode it ensures that all prerequisites for containers to run content from collection sap.sap_operations are met.
      - In assert mode role will fail if any of tasks required are not completed
      - In assert mode role will fail if no repos are enabled
      - Role will only collect facts if OS distribution is not RedHat.
      - Role assumes that container is registered with subscription manager to install packages
      - Role will fail if not executed by root user, this is because sudo is not installed in containers
    options:
      prepare_container_assert:

          - Is set to False (default) will ensure that all prerequisites are met
        type: bool
        required: false
