              - Condition to run check
              - Conditions should use only variables that are provided in checks execution context.
              - ansible_facts and cluster_properties variables are provided in checks execution context.
              - |
                ansible_facts are collected for the host where role is executed,
                so if you are analyzing local xml export of the cluster CIB,
                ansible_facts will be collected for the host where you are
                running the role (for instance localhost).
              - More variables will be provided in checks execution context.
              - |
                Checks are automatically filtered based on the following criteria
                'architecture' variable - either provided as role parameter, or collected from
                ansible_facts
                'platform' and 'version' variables - either provided as role parameters,
                or collected from ansible_facts
                'cloud_provider' - not yet supported.
                Checks filtered out this way will not be even in the main check loop.
              - Another way to filter checks is to use tags. See I(pcs_config_checks_tags_exclude) parameter.
              - |
                If there is a more complex condition when to execute check and when not,
                this condition should be provided individually for each check in parameter I(when).
                For instance, this is how to ignore checks on an odd numbered day.
                {% raw %}
                name: This check will be executed only on even numbered days and will fail.
                condition: false
                when:  "{{ ansible_facts['date_time']['day'] | int % 2 == 0 }}"
                {% endraw %}
                Check will be marked as skipped and not executed if 'when' condition is C(false).
                But this check will appear in list of checks.
