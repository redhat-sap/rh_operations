        Role ensures that all collection sap.sap_operations prerequisites are met.
        Role works in two modes - normal and assert.
        In normal mode it ensures that all prerequisites to run content from collection sap.sap_operations are met.
        In assert mode it fails if collection prerequisites are not met on the host.
