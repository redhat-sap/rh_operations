    description:
      - Role ensures that all collection sap.sap_operations prerequisites are met.
      - Role works in two modes - normal and assert.

      - In assert mode it fails if collection prerequisites are not met on the host.
      - Role will only collect facts if OS distribution is not RedHat.
