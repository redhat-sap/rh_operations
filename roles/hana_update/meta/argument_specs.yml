    short_description: Role updates a SAP HANA system or instance on a given host.
    description:
      - Role updates a SAP HANA system or instance on a given host.
      - A path to new HANA version installation is required.
        It can be specified by variable hana_update_component_medium
      - |
        Limitations:
        - Role was tested only on single host.
        - During upgrade hdblcm is configured to use SSH (not saphostagent) to connect to the host.
        - Role only works on X86_64
        - Role is not idempotent. It will always try to update SAP HANA system.
        - Expected that hdblcm tool will take care of any issues (like updating to previous version)
