# downloadbasket

Role to download SAP SWDC download basket content


Role is idemponent - bits that are already downloaded will not be overwritten again.
Role is checking if there is sufficient space available in destination folder and failing if there is not enough space on mount point
For each file downloaded there is SHA256 checksum available on SAP SWDC, this checksum will be validated.
This is ensure that bits are downloaded correctly and were not tampered with.
Checksum and filename will be used to skip files with same filename and sha256 checksum if they are already available in downloadbasket_destination


Role return variables:
======================
**downloadbasket_register**

Variable contains information about last downloaded content from SAP SWDC download basket
This variable will contain results of all executions of downloadbasket role, for instance
when role executed with different usernames.
