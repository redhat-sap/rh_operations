    short_description: Role to download SAP SWDC download basket content
    description:
      - Role is idemponent - bits that are already downloaded will not be overwritten again.
      - Role is checking if there is sufficient space available in destination folder and failing if there is not enough space on mount point
      - |
        For each file downloaded there is SHA256 checksum available on SAP SWDC, this checksum will be validated.
        This is ensure that bits are downloaded correctly and were not tampered with.
        Checksum and filename will be used to skip files with same filename and sha256 checksum if they are already available in downloadbasket_destination
      - |
        Role return variables:
        **downloadbasket_register**
        Variable is set (using set_fact) by the role and and available after role has been executed.
        Variable contains information about last downloaded content from SAP SWDC download basket
        This variable will contain results of all executions of downloadbasket role, for instance
        when role executed with different usernames.
        Variable is very useful if one wants to do something with downloaded files - unpack them, for instance.
        See role sap.sap_operations.unpack

        Examples:
        "downloadbasket_register": {
        "changed": true,
        "failed": false,
        "files": [
        {
        "DirectDownloadUrl": "https://softwaredownloads.sap.com/file/0020000000098712022",
        "changed": false,
        "failed": false,
        "filename": "SAPCAR_1115-70006237.EXE",
        "sha256": "f362f57ebdc7f8c2e2a2d5532a53e5f2dce26583c1b8c619fe3ed884d979794e"
        },
        {
        "DirectDownloadUrl": "https://softwaredownloads.sap.com/file/0020000000098732022",
        "changed": false,
        "failed": false,
        "filename": "SAPCAR_1115-70006234.EXE",
        "sha256": "d2fddbe1b7e7858da01864837a05a68f2461fad5f01877e4fa9e07b85e9404e6"
        },
        {
        "DirectDownloadUrl": "https://softwaredownloads.sap.com/file/0020000000099952022",
        "changed": false,
        "failed": false,
        "filename": "SAPCAR_1115-70006239.EXE",
        "sha256": "fe2f7ee00ff6d9f7ed7086cae75e66ebe9cc37eb1bf667666c0d7a8cee110cb5"
        }
        ]
        }
        Notes for variable ``downloadbasket_register``:
        With each run of role ``sap.sap_operations.downloadbasket`` data is added to this variable.
        With 5 runs of role ``sap.sap_operations.download`` ``files`` list will contain information about downloaded files from all 5 runs
        This is a feature of the way how ansible handles variables.

    options:
      downloadbasket_destination:
        description: |
          Path where bits will be downloaded.
          Should exists before role execution.
          Ansible user should have write permission to this destination folder.
          Role will check if there is sufficient space available on device.
          If not role will fail with information about space requirements.
          Please be mindful and avoid race condition when this destination is shared folder among several hosts
          - ansible tasks are executed in parallel by default and it might have undesirable consequences.
