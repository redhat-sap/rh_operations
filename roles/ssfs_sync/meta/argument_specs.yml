        Role will find all the SAP instances on source host (see role variables)
        and make sure that SSFS *.KEY and *.DAT files and synced from source host
        to destination hosts (see role variables).
      - Files will be synced to destination hosts only if they exist on destination hosts.
      - Role requires that ansible_user can sudo to root.
      - |
        Role uses ansible.posix.synchronize to sync files and this implies that there should be host to hosts communication established.
        How to generate ssh keys for ansible host to host communication see role sap.sap_operations.ssh_keys_distribute
