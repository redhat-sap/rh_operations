    short_description: Role to download SAP software
    description:
      - Role to download SAP software from SAP Software Download Center (SWDC).
      - Username and password to access SAP SWDC are required.
      - Role is idemponent - bits that are already downloaded will not be downloaded again.
      - Idempotency is working by comparing SHA256 checksum for local files and files to be downloaded.
      - Role is checking if there is sufficient space available in destination folder.
      - Destination folder (variable `download_destination`) should already exist.
      - If destination folder does not exist, not directory or not writeable role will fail
      - |
        For each file downloaded there is SHA256 checksum available on SAP SWDC, this checksum will be validated.
        This is ensure that bits are downloaded correctly and were not tampered with.
        SSL certificate is also checked when bits are downloaded, see download_validate_certs variable below.
      - By default role will download only one file with latest ReleaseDate, see parameters download_sort_attribute and download_one_file
      - |
        Role return variables
        **download_register_last**
        Variable is set by the role and and available after role has been executed.
        Variable contains information about last downloaded SAP alias
        Variable is very useful if one wants to do something with downloaded files - unpack them, for instance.
        See role sap.sap_operations.unpack
        Examples
        "download_register_last": {
        "changed": true,
        "failed": false,
        "files": [
        {
        "DirectDownloadUrl": "https://softwaredownloads.sap.com/file/0020000001293762023",
        "changed": false,
        "failed": false,
        "filename": "saphostagentrpm_62-80004822.rpm",
        "sha256": "1f7864d97268f505cd2cb7ab75188270590ee11ff8418f54229e0ee32f28f618"
        }
        ]
        }
      - Notes for variable ``download_register_last``
      - For each downloaded application there might be several elements in ``files`` list.
      - |
        For each file that is downloaded, there are two variables ``changed`` and ``failed``.
        If these variables are true, this is translated to higher levels.
        If downloading of one url for an application failed, this is translated to variable ``download_register_application_last.changed`` and
        ``download_register_application_last.failed``
      - |
        ``sha256`` provided, because this is checksum from SAP SWDC metadata.
        **download_register**
        Variable is set by the role and and available after role has been executed.
        Variable contains information about all downloaded SAP application. Across several executions of role ``sap.sap_operations.download``
        Variable is very useful if one wants to do something with downloaded files - unpack them, for instance.
        See role sap.sap_operations.unpack
        Examples:
        "download_register": {
        "changed": true,
        "failed": true,
        "files": [
        {
        "DirectDownloadUrl": "https://softwaredownloads.sap.com/file/0020000000269302024",
        "changed": false,
        "failed": false,
        "filename": "saphostagentrpm_63-80004822.rpm",
        "sha256": "673e39245b22cd5b609d7636de13cea9fdc6cb463c86526af5e523cf5c0c908d"
        },

        }
        ]
        }
      - |
        Notes for variable ``download_register``:
      - |
        With each run of role ``sap.sap_operations.download`` data is added to this variable.
        With 5 runs of role ``sap.sap_operations.download`` ``results`` list will contain list of files downloaded in all 5 runs
        This is a feature of the way how ansible handles variables.
