    options:
      sapcar_exe_path:
        description:
          - Path to sapcar executable file
          - Default value is from collection variable sap_operations_sapcar_exe_path
          - All parent directories to directory where sapcar executable should be located should exists and be writable for ansible user
          - Role will not create /usr/sap directory and will not set owner and mode for this
          - Default path is in /usr/sap, role expects that /usr/sap is present and writable for user the role is executed with, otherwise role will fail
          - As part of the role execution parent directory for sapcar_exe_path will be created
        type: path
        required: false
        default: /usr/sap/sapcar/sapcar
      sapcar_state:
        description:
          - State for sapcar executable
          - present - role will ensure that executable will downloaded and installed (copied to sapcar_exe_path)
          - present - will do any changes only if file sapcar_exe_path does not exists
          - absent - role will ensure that file at sapcar_exe_path is absent, containing directory will not be removed
        type: str
        required: false
        default: present
        choices:
          - present
          - absent
      sapcar_download_destination:
        description:
          - Path there sapcar binary will be downloaded (in case of sapcar_state='present')

          - sap.sap_operations.download role will be used to download sapcar binaries
          - |
            sap.sap_operations.download role by default will download patch level with latest ReleaseDate,
            see download role documentation
          - |
            This makes this role quasi idempotent if sapcar_patch_level is not set explicitly -
            later version of sapcar might be downloaded and installed if role executed in different times
          - |
            Should be exact patch level available for current sapcar_version, see documentation for
            sap.sap_operations.download role, otherwise nothing will be downloaded and installed.
          - In case there is no such patch level for selected sapcar version, download list will be empty and role will fail
