          How reboot has to be handled
          none - no reboot will be be required after role applied,
          role will not install packages that might require reboot. Not all requirements can be fulfilled that way.
          List of packages to be skipped see <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/27943>
          postpone - (default behavior) role will not flush handlers at the end of execution, but reboot handler will be notified,
          in this case this is a user obligation to flush handlers (and thus reboot the host).
          now - role will flush handlers at the end of the execution - this is might not be desirable,
          in situations when another role that requires reboot will run after.
