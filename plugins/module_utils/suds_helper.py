    This is to return data to Ansible, otherwise Ansible does not know how to work with returned classes

    There is a strange thing about suds module, if reply contains only one type, it is not returned as reply object,
    but as an object of that type. So we need to check if obj is not reply, and if it is not reply, add classname to resulting dict.
    This is where decided to return reply or not.
