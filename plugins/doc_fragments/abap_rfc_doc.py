            ABAP allows two different ways to store strings
            A fixed length string type C and a dynamic length string type STRING.
          - Strings of type C are padded with blanks, if the content is shorter than the predefined length.
          - In order to unify the connectors behavior regarding strings, the rstrip option was introduced.
          - If set to True, all strings are right-stripped before being returned by an RFC call.
          - See <http://sap.github.io/PyRFC/client.html>
          - There is no equivalent parameter when connecting via HTTP(s), see I(http_connection).
        type: bool
        default: True
      return_import_params:
        description:
          - Importing parameters of RFC call are returned by the RFC call
          - Usually, you do not need the IMPORT parameters in the result of Connection.call().
          - If I(return_import_params) is set to C(False), parameters of type IMPORT are filtered out.
          - |
            Setting I(return_import_params) to C(True) is only recommended for debugging purposes.
            This will change return values of all NW RFC modules.
